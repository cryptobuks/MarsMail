# MarsMail

What can I say?

If ur on Mars and ur like 'i got no ways to contact any servers or something cause they froze' then download this app fam.

Could save ur lyfe. jk jk this is just supposed to be a completely P2P mobile app on iOS built in Swift that'll store 
everything locally and use no centralized servers. This is done with Couchbase Lite(hopefully).
