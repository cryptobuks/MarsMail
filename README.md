# MarsMail

What can I say?

If ur on Mars and ur like 'i got no ways to contact any servers or something cause they froze' then download this app fam.

Could save ur lyfe. jk jk this is just supposed to be a completely P2P mobile app on iOS built in Swift that'll store 
everything locally and use no centralized servers. This is done with Couchbase Lite(hopefully).

**Unfortunately I haven't had the necessary time to contribute to this body of work. My goal is to recover this project by the end of July, and if I don't this repo will be deleted. So, until then, no edits from this dude but please reach out if you have any ideas!**
